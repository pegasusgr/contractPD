\section{The main idea}
Here we are playing what we call a contract game in a prisoner's dilemma on a spatial lattice.

The idea is that a player can offer a part of what he earns ($\Delta$) to the other player to make it convenient to cooperate, conditional on the event of both players cooperating. Of course he might be tempted to defect but, due to the preference of errors, maybe the cooperation will be stable.

In its simplest form, the model we propose is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Agents are placed on a network, such as a ring, a Von Neumann lattice or a Moore lattice.

\item Agents play with their neighbours the following game:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
$i 	\setminus j$ & C & D & $\Delta$ \\ 
\hline 
C & r,r & -a,1 & r+$\delta$, r-$\delta$ \\ 
\hline 
D & 1,-a & 0,0 & 1, -a \\ 
\hline 
$\Delta$ & r- $\delta$, r+$\delta$ & -a, 1 & r,r \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}
The payoff matrix represents the game that we described above.
In addition to the cooperate and defect, an agent can choose to play the strategy $\Delta$ that represents the possibility of offering an unequal share of the cooperation reward to the other player.
The offer is a contract that states that in the case of the receiving player cooperating, it will receive an amount $\delta$ in addition to the cooperation reward.
The $\delta$ is taken from the share of the offering player so that there is no creation of wealth.
Hence $\delta \in \left[0,r \right]$.
In the case of two agents both offering the contract, each agent receives the fair cooperation payoff.
As usual in prisoner's dilemma games, $r$ indicates the reward and $a$ the sucker's payoff. Hence we have that $  -a < 0 < r < 1 $.

\item Agents can observe the payoffs obtained by their neighbours and imitate the strategy that seems to lead to the higher payoff.
We also allow for errors in the imitation function.
It is important to notice that due to the presence of errors it is possible for any strategy to emerge even if at a given time no agent on the network is playing it.
\end{itemize}


We implement the idea in several different ways:

\subsection{Logit best response:}
The players choose their strategy according to a logit best response with parameter beta, responding to the strategy array of the previous round.

This means that given an array of strategies $S^{t-1}$ at time $t-1$, player $i$ plays strategy $s_k$ at time $t$ with probability $p_k$ given by:
$$
p_{k}=\frac{e^{\beta EU\left(s_{k}\mid S_{-i}^{t-1}\right)}}{\sum_{s_{j}}e^{\beta EU\left(s_{j}\mid S_{-i}^{t-1}\right)}}
$$

where $ S_{-i}^{t-1}$ is the array representing the strategies of all agents but agent $i$
and $EU\left(s_{k}\mid S_{-i}^{t-1}\right)$ is the expected utility\footnote{Computed as the average payoff obtained by the interaction of $i$ with its nearest neighbours} of strategy $s_k$.

Below are some examples of results we obtained.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Percentage of players playing each strategy for two different values of $\delta$.

}
\label{fig:BR}
\end{figure} 

Unfortunately, as shown in the picture, it seems that there is no difference in the level of cooperation between the "control case" where $\delta=0$ fig. \ref{fig:BR_nodelta} and the case where $\delta>0$  fig. \ref{fig:BR_nodelta} and such that to cooperate is a best response to $\Delta$.

\subsection{Imitation}
Here we introduce another rule with which players update their strategies.

Instead of best responding, each agent can imitate the strategies that its neighbours are playing with a probability depending on the average payoff that each strategy can materialize.

Based on \cite{Eshel1998} we implement the  imitation rule in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each agent observes the payoff that every one of its neighbours received and the strategy they played.

\item It then computes what was the average payoff for each strategy (including its own payoff).

\item The agent chooses a strategy $s_k$ with probability $p_k$ equal to:
$$
p_{k}=\frac{e^{\beta Av\left(s_{k}\right)}}{\sum_{s_{j}}e^{\beta Av\left(s_{j}\right)}}
$$
where $Av\left(s_{k}\right)$ is the average payoff computed for strategy $s_k$.

\item It is important to notice that if none of an agent neighbours are playing strategy $s_k$, the agent has no probability to choose that strategy unless it played it itself the round before.

\item To allow for spontaneous emergence of strategy, after updating its strategy each player has a small probability $\mu$ to randomly mutate to a new strategy.
\end{itemize}

Below are some of the results we obtained in this case:

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Percentage of players playing each strategy for two different values of $\delta$.
Fig (a) shows the percentage of players defecting (green line) in the case $\delta =0$. This is the case in which the strategy $\Delta$ is equivalent to cooperation.
We can see how in fig (b) there is no difference in the level of defection even though the value of $\delta$ is such that to cooperate leads to an higher payoff than to defect when close to a $\Delta$ player.
The kind of lattice used in the simulation is the Von Neumann lattice.
The picture is obtained in the case of agents imitating their neighbours strategy.
}
\label{fig:IM}
\end{figure} 

Also in this case, as shown in the picture, it seems that there is no difference in the level of cooperation between the "control case" where $\delta=0$ fig. \ref{fig:IM_nodelta} and the case where $\delta>0$  fig. \ref{fig:IM_nodelta} and such that to cooperate leads to the highest payoff when playing close to a $\Delta$ player.

\subsubsection{Variant on the payoff}

We also studied the case in which the offer of a contract is conditional on the strategy played by the receiving player.

In particular, we studied what happens in case $\Delta$ players only offer the contract to platers that were defecting the turn before.
In case a player was already a cooperator or a $\Delta$ player itself the turn before, playing $\Delta$ return equivalent payoff than cooperating.

Also in this case, as shown in \ref{fig:IM2} it seems that the presence of the $\Delta$ strategy has no impact on the percentage of cooperators and defectors.

\label{fig:IM2}
\end{figure} 


\subsection{Logit best response with 4 strategies and directed transitions}
We now introduce another strategy: $-\Delta$. Players that use this strategy, if their opponent cooperates, will take a larger part of the pie. More specifically, they will get $r+\delta$ and their opponent will receive $r-\delta$. The payoff matrix is, therefore amended to be the following:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
• & C & D &$+\Delta$ & $-\Delta$  \\ 
\hline 
C & $r$ , $r$ & $-a$ , 1 & $r+\delta$, $r-\delta$ & $r-\delta$, $r+\delta$ \\ 
\hline 
D & 1 , $-a$ & 0,0 & 1, $-a$ & 1,$-a$\\ 
\hline 
$+\Delta$ & $r -\delta$, $r+\delta$ & $-a$, 1 & $r$ , $r$& $r-2\delta$, $r+2\delta$ \\ 
\hline 
$-\Delta$ & $r+\delta$ , $r-\delta$ & $-a$, 1 & $r+2\delta$ , $r-2\delta$ & $r$ ,$ r$\\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

Similarly as in in the previous case, there is a logit rule in the way that agents switch strategies. Crucially, we allow only for specific transitions to tale place. These are shown in Figure \ref{diagram}.  

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=3cm,

        edge [loop right] node {} (4)
        edge [bend right] node[right] {} (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Transitions in the 4 strategy case. An arrow indicates a transition that is allowed.}\label{diagram}
\end{figure}

Some of the results the simulations gave us can be seen in figure \ref{fig:4strat}. Results show that the introduction of the $-\Delta$ strategy increases the amount of defectors. Moreover, the $-\Delta$ strategists do better than the more cooperative strategies but worse than defect.
%Results show that the directional transitions do not change the percentage of cooperators in the long run (see Figure \ref{fig:4strat}).

\section{Future}

\subsection{Best responders with imitators}
We are thinking of approaching the problem in a different way. In a model where players may be either (i) best responding with probability $p$ or (ii) imitating with probability $1-p$. 

Intuitively, players do not always just imitate, but with some probability they may be thinking about the situation a bit more and best-respond. A reference for a research paper that does something similar is \citet{DziubinskiRoy2012}.

We think that this might work. This would be because as soon as a few $\Delta$ strategist appear close together, best responders around them would follow $C$. More than that, imitators around them would start cooperating too. So, the idea is that a (or a few) $\Delta$ individuals may work like seeds for the spread of cooperation.
